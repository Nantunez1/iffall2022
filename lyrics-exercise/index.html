            <h1>Love Like You</h1>
            <h2>Rebecca Sugar</h2>
        <p>
        If I could begin to be<br>
        Half of what you think of me<br>
        I could do about anything<br>
        I could even learn how to love
        </p>

        <p>
        When I see the way you act<br>
        Wondering when I'm coming back<br>
        I could do about anything<br>
        I could even learn how to love like you<br>
        (Love like you)
        </p>

        <p>
        I always thought I might be bad <br>
        Now I'm sure that it's true <br>
        'Cause I think you're so good <br>
        And I'm nothing like you
        </p>

        <p>
        Look at you go <br>
        I just adore you <br>
        I wish that I knew <br>
        What makes you think I'm so special
        </p>

        <p>
        If I could begin to do <br>
        Something that does right by you <br>
        I would do about anything <br.
        I would even learn how to love
        </p>

        <p>
        When I see the way you look <br>
        Shaken by how long it took <br>
        I could do about anything <br>
        I could even learn how to love like you
        </p>

        <p>
        Love like you <br>
        Love me like you
        </p>
