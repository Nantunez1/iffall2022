        <p><strong>1.</strong> My name is Natalie Antunez, I am majoring in communication Design, and I am a junior.</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> I love to create and when I graduate I hope to get into character design. I took this class because html is a good skill to have.</p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> I took Intro to CS last year and that is about it when it comes to experience with HTML/CSS/JS.  </p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> I hope to learn html. I am working from ground zero, but I am pretty excited to see what I can make!</p>
        <p><strong>5.</strong> Once something is on paper it can't move and from that point on it is pretty much permanent. Every decision matters so much, however on the screen the elements are meant to be altered and there is no sense of permanence. </p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> The <a href="https://www.lacroixwater.com/"> Lacroix website</a> has a very cute design. Very pleasing to just scroll down and see all the designs displayed. The color choice an dtypeface they used all wokr relaly well to create this cute and lovely website.</p> 
        <p><strong>7.</strong> I think that the rock climbing website <a href="https://planet-rock.com/"> Planet Rock </a>Displays all the information anyone would intially want in a clean and even minimalistic way.</p>
        <p><strong>8.</strong> I think that <a href="https://www.etsy.com/"> Etsy </a> works very well in both design, communication, and navigation. The design is quite simple and homely. Very easy to understand and navigate yourself through the website and through shops. </p>
