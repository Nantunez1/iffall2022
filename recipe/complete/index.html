    <p>Arroz Con Leche is best served afer made, however if you have left overs it is best to put the pudding into a bowl and then put plastic wrap on top of the pudding making it airtight! It is important that it is not exposed to air! Rice pudding can be served hot or cold based on your preferences.</p>
