<h3>Arroz Con Leche After Care</h3>
<p>Rice pudding is best served afer made, however if you have left overs it is best to put the pudding into a bowl and then put plastic wrap on top of the pudding making it airtight! It is important that it is not exposed to air! 
<br>
You can eat it hot or cold based on your preferences.

    I think it is nice that along with the the directions there is a video that the user can follow along with. I don't know how much I appreciate the categories but that is another conversation. What I don't like is the condesed paragraph of instructions. Personally I think that a list is easier to follow.

I like how simple this website makes it and I also really apprecate the tips section. I think what the website is missing is good formatting.

I think Yummly has amazing readability, provides a good amount of information and is just very easy to use.

    I think that the Lacroix website integrates pictures very well into the website. The color scheme they used complements the pictures very well and thus creates a nice aesthetic.

    In the garoa skin care website they treat type, image, and colors so wonderfully. Its fun to scroll through and relaxing to browse. While not to the extent of the website, I would like to create a fun (or nice) experience for the user.

  The Etsy website has a very nice readability to it that allows for the reader to have an easy and relaxing moment when browsing multiple items. I find that they do a very good job at balancing the chaos that comes with shopping and the aesthetics that comes with a physical store.
